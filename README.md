- Files will be added as I pogress this cource but for time being, I do not reccomend using repository.My reccomendation si just reccomentatio -  you are free to use it  it if you like

# Using repository:
- Eveything that starts with # is a comment, everything that starts with """ is actual code.
- In case you want to use it remove """ code """ and run python nameofthefile
#

# I'd like to thank to Harvard University, HarvardEXd, ExD platform, profesor David J. Malan and eveyone at cs50 for making this possbile
