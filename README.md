# Project name: HarvardX--S50P
# This is CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python for my prsonal learning and practices
- Author: Zagorka MartinoviÄ‡
- Version 0.0.1
- Files will be added as I progress through this course so for the time being, I do not recommend using this repository. My recommendation is just recommendation -  you are free to clone it if you like

# Using the repository
- Everything that starts with # is a comment, everything that starts with """ is actual code.
- In case you want to use and test it remove """ code """ and run python nameofthefile


# I'd like to thank Harvard University, HarvardedX platform, professor David J. Malan and everyone at cs50 for making this possible
